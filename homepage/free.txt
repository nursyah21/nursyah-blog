intended to free from relapse

why you relapse,
this is called addiction, cure your addiction.first we can reduce addiction, like frequent we doing it. like, if we used relapse 3x/day we can reduce to 1x/day, 1x/day to 3x/day and continuously until we free from addiction.

but bear with it not easy, you can always relapse everytime. you have to realize is not going easy, even bear with it 1 day is so hard. doing everything you can to distract you addiction.
like study, listen song, playing game, read manga, or sleep.
you have to realize what you have done is wrong.

create your schedule, and you must discipline to it.
like everyday wake up at 5.00 and shower.
prayer, study your favorite subject. 

make a target is possible for you, if you make a target like 40days no relapse, but holding for 21days you can't, is not realistic. make a realist target, if you the highest holding relapse in this month is 3days, so make it to 3days and bear with it.
