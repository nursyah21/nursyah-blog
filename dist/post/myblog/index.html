			<h1 class="text-gradient">Nursyah&#39;s blog</h1><p class="text-xs">28-12-2022</p><br><p>for programmers, a personal web is a place to put a portfolio, as well as to show their expertise in the field of web technology.
<br><br></p>
<p>the website itself can be dynamic and static, dynamic websites themselves are like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a>, as a programmer myself I want a website that is easy to customize and free or at least affordable in this case wordpress is not the answer.
<br><br></p>
<p>here I am confused about how to customize the appearance of the website so that it fits what I want. to upload our theme, we have to pay. I finally gave up :( <a href="https://nursyahx.wordpress.com/">my wordpress</a></p>
<p><img src="/myblog/wordpress.png" alt="wordpress">
<br></p>
<p>then how can we make a website that is easy to customize and at an affordable price, luckily there are services like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> or similar to upload static web for free.</p>
<p>This website itself uses the services of github pages for hosting. we can also add a domain name if we want, but I think using a github.io as a domain looks pretty cool.
<br><br></p>
<p>then the first website that I created and that I put on the github page, was like this <a href="https://nursyah21.github.io/archive_hugo_web/">my first website</a></p>
<p><img src="/myblog/hugo.png" alt="hugo"></p>
<p>This website uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators with its amazing speed and flexibility. The reason I use this, because Hugo uses <a href="https://go.dev/">golang</a>
at that time I want to learn to use golang, so why don’t I try to make a website using golang
<br><br></p>
<p>at least it’s better in terms of customization than before, but it’s still quite difficult to customize. my website use theme <a href="https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke">ananke</a>,</p>
<p>but Hugo’s advantage is that the build speed itself is very fast, less than 1 second, and if you are satisfied with the theme that has been provided and you are focused on writing an article, Hugo is the right choice.</p>
