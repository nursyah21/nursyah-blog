description: Story of my personal page
--- 


for programmers, a personal web is a place to put a portfolio, as well as to show their expertise in the field of web technology.
<br><br>

the website itself can be dynamic and static, dynamic websites themselves are like [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), as a programmer myself I want a website that is easy to customize and free or at least affordable in this case wordpress is not the answer.
<br><br>

here I am confused about how to customize the appearance of the website so that it fits what I want. to upload our theme, we have to pay. I finally gave up :( [my wordpress](https://nursyahx.wordpress.com/)

<br>

then how can we make a website that is easy to customize and at an affordable price, luckily there are services like [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or similar to upload static web for free.

This website itself uses the services of github pages for hosting. we can also add a domain name if we want, but I think using a github.io as a domain looks pretty cool.
<br><br>

then the first website that I created and that I put on the github page, was like this [my first website](https://nursyah21.github.io/archive_hugo_web/)

![hugo](/myblog/hugo.png)

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators with its amazing speed and flexibility. The reason I use this, because Hugo uses [golang](https://go.dev/)
at that time I want to learn to use golang, so why don't I try to make a website using golang
<br><br>

at least it's better in terms of customization than before, but it's still quite difficult to customize. my website use theme [ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke),

but Hugo's advantage is that the build speed itself is very fast, less than 1 second, and if you are satisfied with the theme that has been provided and you are focused on writing an article, Hugo is the right choice.
