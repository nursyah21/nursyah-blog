**Introduction**

for programmers, a personal web is a place to put a portfolio, as well as to show their expertise in the field of web technology.
<br><br>

as you may know [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) is popular tool to create website, even if you are not someone in this field there are thousands or maybe millions people using it to create their website.

but on my personal opinion, wordpress is quite difficult to customize how it look. here I am confused about how to customize the appearance so that it fits what I want. [curious aboy my wordpress](https://nursyahx.wordpress.com/)

then let's move to alternative solution.

at that time there was a popular tool to create static site, namely [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so i begin to create my new personal website with this tool, you can see my previous website using this tool in -> [my website hugo](https://nursyah21.github.io/archive_hugo_web/)
<br><br>

however after spending time with hugo, i realized that i just want to create static site without articles. just show about me. and again i move from hugo to use [vite]([https://vitejs.dev/]) as frontend tool, [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) as frontend framework and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as css framework.

you see i like to learn something new that's way i move from technology to another technology, curious how it look [click this link](/archiveweb_vue/index.html)
<br><br>

<br><br>

and now i want to create website like my previous web with feature articles but easy to customize.

fortunately there's a tool called [astro](https://astro.build/) to make it happen, in astro there already exist a feature markdown like hugo and structure project like vue and so this is the result of my website using astro
