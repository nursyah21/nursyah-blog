# todo app
This is the first application created after learning from the Flutter tutorial on how to make a counter app. Here, I learned how to perform CRUD operations with a Firebase backend.

# message app
The second application created is a messaging app. Here, I learned authentication with Firebase. This is a fairly simple application utilizing Firestore and Firebase Authentication features.

# habit tracker app
The Habit tracking application is an app to track your habits that runs locally without using Firebase. Here, I learned how to use Isar to store data locally.

# image text gemini app
This application aims to analyze images using AI Gemini. Here, I learned how to obtain device permissions and use HTTP to connect to the Gemini REST API.

# music player app
This application is used for listening to music. It is not a full-fledged music player as the listed songs are pre-provided in the app, not from the device. Here, I learned how to use the audio player in Flutter and create a UI similar to a music player.
